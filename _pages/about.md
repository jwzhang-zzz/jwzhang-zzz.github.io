My name is Jingwen Zhang, and I am a third-year Ph.D. student in the School of Software Engineering at Sun Yat-sen University, supervised by Prof. Zibin Zheng and Prof. Yuhong Nan. My current research interests lie primarily in blockchain reliability, program analysis, and LLM4SE. I am also interested in visual analytics, although I have not worked on this topic for quite some time.
